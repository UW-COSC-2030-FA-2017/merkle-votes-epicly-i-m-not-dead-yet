(DONE)create a helper function for locate in bTREE.cpp
	check if current node is target
	otherwise check if left is not null
		go down if not
	then check if right is not null
		go down if not

(DONE)do initial check in non-helper function locate if target is in tree
	use find function

(DONE)finish find function to allow locate to work properly
	work way through tree
	maybe use another help function?

(DONE)edit insert function into binary tree format (currently in search tree format)
	fill from left to right
	no string comparison (< or >) 

(DONE)work on dataInserted
	what needs to be done?
	return the number of data nodes in the tree

overloaders in bTREE need to check entire tree
	not just root

find out what hashes are needed and how to do it (return strings)
	check if the output is supposed to be an int or a string
	write functions first, then comment out
	will probably need to create own functions, based on mathematical equations -- can get from internetz
	use to_string method to convert the ints to strings

create functions in pMT.cpp
	may need helper functions, similar to bTREE.cpp

make tree before filling
	this allows for leafs to be already made instead of on the fly
	may need a copy constructor with second parameter to create like this
	determine file size and find out how many leaves are needed

work on overloader functions in pMT.cpp
	make sure to check Q&A for any updates on correct outputs

determine what locate functions need to do

(IN PROGRESS)insert using queue
	get help with usage

parent node of leaf will need to have the hash of its two children nodes

*****don't need to create XOR overloader function in pMT
