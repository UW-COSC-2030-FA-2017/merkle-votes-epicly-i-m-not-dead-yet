(DONE)create a helper function for locate in bTREE.cpp
	check if current node is target
	otherwise check if left is not null
		go down if not
	then check if right is not null
		go down if not

(DONE)do initial check in non-helper function locate if target is in tree
	use find function

(DONE)finish find function to allow locate to work properly
	work way through tree
	maybe use another help function?

(DONE)edit insert function into binary tree format (currently in search tree format)
	fill from left to right
	no string comparison (< or >) 

work on dataInserted
	what needs to be done?

find out what hashes are needed and how to do it
	***see if you can use hash functions from lab 9
		if able, will need to find out how to change to string output

create functions in pMT.cpp
	may need helper functions, similar to bTREE.cpp
